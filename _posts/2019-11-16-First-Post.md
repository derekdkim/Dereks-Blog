title: There's a first time for everything.

I was always afraid of writing a blog. Every time I read one, it felt like the author knew exactly what they were doing and their words always flowed so eloquently. I can barely hold a conversation together, so what made me think I can write one? I'm also a complete newbie when it comes to coding, so anything I learn probably won't contribute much either. These were the kinds of excuses I was telling myself.

As I finished up my Master's Degree and prepared to solo travel for the better part of a year, I suddenly became more open to getting out of my comfort zone. Even though I was (and still am) ashamed of my current skill level, I decided to go for it since it will be a good way to keep myself accountable and reflect more on things I learn. Plus, it will be great to look back at where I was in the past.
